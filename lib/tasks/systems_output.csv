This application is a Windows Service that is installed on the PRM Application Server. It is responsible for polling the PRM database for tieback action requests (tieback table) and initiating the associate system function based on the action type.

Currently Tieback support the following action types:Block: This requests a card status change in the appropriate host system, either B2K for credit cards or Ultracs for debit cards. The status change requested is determined by the state property of the action request. If state = 0 then a logical unblock is requested bringing the card into an active state if host business rules allow. If state=1 then a local block is requested bring the card into a restricted state if business rules allow.Fraud: This requests the creation of a CaseBook case if one does not already exist for this card.Call: This requests a General Note/Action Note being created that can be viewed through In Touch/Prosper respectively.Memo: This requests a General Note/Action Note being created that can be viewed through In Touch/Prosper respectively.POC Block: See Block.
All these action requests are services through middleware calls and all will end with the Tieback update the action request with the result of performing the requested action.

NZClear is used for the following tasks:   To view and manage KiwibankÕs ESAS account~ Buy and Sell NZD denominated~ Securities. Issue Kiwibank short dated discounted securities~ Settlement of some of Kiwibank NZD cash obligations~ Holds our portfolio of NZD denominated securities~ Settlement of SBI transactions under 3LC conditions (future state under SBI from early 2012. 3LC can be invoked by Kiwibank or another bank)~ Note: 3LC refers to the use of NZ Clear for file transfer and settlement~ in the event that SWIFT services~ Kiwibanks SWIFT connectivity or RBNZ SWIFT connectivity is unavailable. It is also the only means through which Kiwibank Treasury and support staff can view the Kiwibank ESAS account in real time.  NZ Clear has been enhanced to allow the sending bank to upload interchange files into the NZ Clear system (prior to Cash P or R entered)~ and the receiving bank to download the interchange file (after Cash P or R).  Accordingly~ this provides a solution for both file interchange and settlement.  Operational Processes~ The Interbank Wash-up is an absolute essential~ performed daily between 7.00 am and 8.30 am. Usually takes approx. 1.30 hrs for the Treasury Operations team to settle. Cut-off for NZClear is 8.30am sharp. Treasury Operations team receive a fax and email from EDS with the list of transactions via the banking network. Treasury Operations then use NZClear to enter these transactions. Note: This reflects the current state~ not as it will be under SBI.  Under SBI~ overnight processing is no longer routed through EDS.  Settlement will be on a gross bilateral basis via SWIFT.  The ÒWash-upÓ period will still exist but more so for the banks to attempt to square up their accounts at the Reserve Bank to levels they are happy with rather than the settlement of retail flow based transactions.  There are 6 PCs with a dedicated IP address to the Reserve Bank. Four in the Treasury Operations team~ and two from Wholesale IT. Plus 2 PCs at the Treasury/Treasury Support BCP site on level 12 of Radio New Zealand House. Each PC has its own static IP address to enabled it to pass through the kiwibank firewall to access to reserve Bank NZClear system via a common IP address.""",Collateral Management,tier_1,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the temporary closure~ customersÕ accounts may be frozen and the Statutory Manager will determine the funds required to meet the bankÕs obligations to the industry.

Mobile Top Up,external,actor,external,,,,,,,,,,,tier_2,,,,"The Mobile Top-up service enables customers to top-up their Vodafone or Telecom prepay phones or mobile accounts directly from their Kiwibank account, using their mobile phones. Mobile top up is a Vodafone Hotlink service, supported by Vodafone.
To subscribe to mobile top up, the customer supplies their phone number, selects one of their debit cards and supplies a password. Information is passed to the service provider - ETSL.

ETSL (Kiwibank Eftpos service provider) offer a registration service that includes Vodafone and Telecom. Customers subscribe via Internet banking only and subscription information is kept at ETSL.

When making a mobile top up, the customer supplies a password, a dollar amount and selects the account, similar to an Eftpos transaction. The transaction is processed by the Eftpos switch, but without a PIN - the password has been validated by ETSL.",,sod,keep,,,,,
