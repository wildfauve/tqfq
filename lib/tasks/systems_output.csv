This amount will be transferred to accounts under the control of the Statutory Manager and the remainder then unfrozen and available to customers the following day.
A condition of registration as a bank (from June 2013) is to be pre-positioned for this funds freeze event if it is required.

Components and Functionality
The OBR process brings together existing functionality~ updates to existing extracts to add additional transaction information and the development of a database. This database~ Tabatha~ will store the extracted transaction information~ calculate funds freeze values and provide update files to the different transaction systems.

Prepaid Application Processing System  (PAPS),system,enterprise_application,Y,"Kiwibank Payment Services offer a range of prepaid card products:
The Prezzy VISA card is a non-embossed prepaid card that is accepted electronically at all VISA merchants.  Unlike a credit card it must have a credit balance before the customer can use the card. 
The Loaded VISA card is a non-embossed personalised prepaid card that is accepted at all electronic VISA merchants. As with the Prezzy Card and unlike a credit card~ the Loaded card must have a credit balance before it can be used; this card can be reloaded with additional funds over the life of the card.
Note: See VPS under Related Systems which is the new prepaid cards platform for newly issued Prezzy and Loaded cards (from Dec 2011)~ and for all Loaded for Travel and Christmas Visa cards.

PAPS is the repository where application data goes into; Prezzy cards do not feed into PAPS only loaded cards.PAPS selects the status of the application dependant on application information such as identification provided and fees paid.  Once an application is in a particular status~ the application will go to eFunds who return information whether an account has been created or not.

There are three sources for applications (for new Loaded cards~ addition of new cardholders) that exist for PAPS:

Datamail 
Secure Website (https://www.loadedcard.co.nz/) 
Manually directly into PAPS by the Payment Services~ Service Delivery Team
Processing of applications (new~ additional~ supplementary (identification checks)~ website and Sharepoint maintenance) all occur through the web services layer.  As part of the Change Management process~ any changes to PAPS must be flowed into MIS.
